# CodeSnack

Want to improve your understanding of Ruby? One way is to read a lot of code. CodeSnack chooses one of the gems installed on your system, pops open its source code, then presents the first twenty-five lines for you to read in a terminal.

## Installation

At the command line:

    $ gem install code_snack

## Usage

At the command line:

    $ code_snack

The result will be 25 lines of a randomly chosen gem's source code,
printed to the console.

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
